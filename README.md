# WorkoutCreator Shiny App

This mobile friendly app allows you to receive a random bodyweight, kettlebell, or a mixture of both, exercise, and email it to yourself.

#### As noted in the app's Info tab, the difficulties are as follows:
* Beginner: 20 second duration sets
* Intermediate: 30 second duration sets
* Advanced: 45 second duration sets

#### The difficulty is an estimate and you should also take into consideration the following:
* Total workout duration
* Weight of kettlebell (if applicable)
* Number of reps completed/set (i.e. speed at which you perform each exercise)
* Exercise experience
* Your fitness

Feel free to lookup any of the exercises if you are unsure of how to do them. [Anthony DiLuglio](https://www.youtube.com/user/aosjeff/search?query=kettlebell/) and [Onnit](https://www.youtube.com/user/OnnitLabs/search?query=kettlebell/) have great kettlebell videos otherwise.

_Note: This app was intended to be used on mobile devices with small screen sizes_
