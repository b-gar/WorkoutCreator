# WorkoutCreator Shiny App

This app allows you to create a random bodyweight or kettlebell exercise, or a mixture of both, and email it to yourself.

#### As noted in the app's Info tab, the difficulties are as follows:
* Beginner: 20 second duration sets
* Intermediate: 30 second duration sets
* Advanced: 45 second duration sets

## **Important** #### The difficulty is an estimate and you should also take into consideration the following:
* Total workout duration
* Weight of kettlebell (if applicable)
* Number of reps completed/set (i.e. speed at which you perform each exercise)
* Exercise experience
* Your fitness
